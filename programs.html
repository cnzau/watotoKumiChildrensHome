			<h3>Counseling, Case Management, Trauma & Day Treatment:</h3>
			<p>
			We provide counseling, case management and treatment services for children ages 3 through 8.
			</p>

			<h4>Mental Health Assessments</h4>
				<p>
				A clinical evaluation by a licensed professional helps to offer a full understanding about a child's current challenges and mental health needs, and helps determine the most appropriate treatment.
				</p>
			<h4>Early Childhood Day Treatment</h4>
				<p>
				The most intensive of our mental health programs for young children ages 3 through 8, our day treatment program provides a structured, therapeutic environment where children work on building attachments, modifying behaviors, and improving overall functioning to reach their individualized goals.
				</p>
				<p>This 3.5-hour program also aids children in building positive relationships and maintaining progress outside of the therapeutic environment. The focus of each Early Childhood Day Treatment program includes:
				<ul>
				<li>Promoting behaviors that are developmentally, socially, and age appropriate</li>
				<li>Supporting the healthy development and functioning of young children and their families throughout a variety of environments and contexts</li>
				<li>Parental involvement to assist caregivers in meeting the social, emotional, and developmental needs of their young children.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			<h4>Trauma Treatment</h4>
				<p>
				Therapy-traumaThe Children's Home recognizes the impact early childhood experiences have on children's overall health and well being. Impactful events might include natural disasters, animal bites, car accidents, serious medical illness or treatments, witnessing or experiencing violence, physical or sexual abuse or neglect.
				</p><p>
				All therapists at The Children's Home are trained in trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy. They are able to help mitigate the effects of adverse childhood experiences by promoting safety, providing education to children and caregivers, and offering techniques for restructuring the mind and body's response to trauma reminders.
				</p>
			<h4>Psychiatric Services</h4>
				<p>
				SadFace-servicesMedication and psychiatric services are designed to reduce, stabilize and eliminate psychiatric symptoms in children. Services are provided by a child psychiatrist, pediatrician or registered nurse for children already participating in our day treatment, behavioral counseling therapy and community psychiatric support services.
